## Quick Start

### Option A: Automated Sync (Recommended for web chat)

Best for: Always-fresh data via GitHub, zero maintenance after setup.

→ [json-auto-sync/SETUP.md](json-auto-sync/SETUP.md)

### Option B: Manual Export

Best for: One-off exports, different time ranges, no GitHub needed.

→ [json-manual/SETUP.md](json-manual/SETUP.md)

### Option C: Local Automated Sync

Best for: Agentic platforms (OpenClaw, Claude Code, Cowork, etc.) running on the same machine as your data. Always-fresh data, no GitHub needed, maximum privacy.

→ [json-local-sync/SETUP.md](json-local-sync/SETUP.md)

### Option D: On-Demand Sync

Best for: Phone or browser users who want fresh data without a schedule or local Python. Trigger a sync from your repo's README, download the results.

→ [json-on-demand/SETUP.md](json-on-demand/SETUP.md)

## Shared Files

Both methods use the same `sync.py` script and produce these files:

| File | Purpose | Auto-created |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `latest.json` | Current 7-day training data for AI consumption | Yes |
| `history.json` | Longitudinal data — daily (90d), weekly (180d), monthly (3y) | Yes |
| `intervals.json` | Per-interval segment data for recent structured sessions | Yes |
| `routes.json` | Route/terrain data for events with GPX/TCX attachments | When attachments exist |
| `ftp_history.json` | FTP tracking for Benchmark Index | Yes |
| `archive/` | Timestamped snapshots (auto-sync only) | Yes |

See [json-examples/](json-examples/) for example output showing the full v3.86 schema.

```bash
# Manual local export
python sync.py --output latest.json

# Push to GitHub
python sync.py

# Different time range
python sync.py --days 90 --output 90days.json
```

See individual SETUP.md files for detailed instructions.

### Derived Metrics

Pre-calculated values for Section 11 compliance — AI should use these, not calculate its own:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `acwr` | Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio (0.8–1.3 optimal) |
| `recovery_index` | HRV/RHR composite (>1.0 = good recovery) |
| `monotony` / `strain` | Training variability (Foster) |
| `grey_zone_percentage` | Z3 time % — minimize in polarized training |
| `quality_intensity_percentage` | Z4+ time % — target ~20% |
| `easy_time_ratio` | Easy time ratio — target ~0.80 |
| `consistency_index` | Plan adherence (completed/planned) |
| `phase_detected` | Auto-detected: Build, Base, Peak, Taper, Deload, Recovery, Overreached, null |
| `phase_detection` | Full phase detection object: phase, confidence, reason_codes, basis (dual-stream), phase_duration_weeks |
| `benchmark_indoor` / `benchmark_outdoor` | 8-week FTP progression |
| `seiler_tid_7d` / `seiler_tid_28d` | Seiler TID classification (Polarized/Pyramidal/Threshold/HIT/Base) |
| `capability.durability` | Aggregate decoupling 7d/28d mean + trend (improving/stable/declining) |
| `capability.tid_comparison` | TID drift detection (consistent/shifting/acute_depolarization) |
| `readiness_decision` | Pre-computed go/modify/skip with priority ladder (P0–P3) and signal breakdown |
| `capability.efficiency_factor` | Aerobic efficiency (power÷HR normalized) 7d/28d with trend |
| `capability.hrrc` | Heart rate recovery 7d/28d aggregate trend (improving/stable/declining) |

## Report Templates

The [reports/](reports/) folder contains Section 11-compliant templates:

| Template | Use case |
|----------|----------|
| `PRE_WORKOUT_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md` | Briefing before a session |
| `POST_WORKOUT_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md` | Analysis after a session |
| `*_EXAMPLES.md` | Anonymized examples showing normal and threshold-breach scenarios |

Use these to standardize AI coaching output across platforms.
