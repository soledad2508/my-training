## Field Definitions

| Field | Source | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Compliance** | Planned vs completed activities | ✅ completed as planned, ⚠️ modified, ❌ missed |
| **Quality Session Detail** | Hard/intensity sessions only | Matches post-workout report metrics for consistency |
| **Grey Zone %** | Z3 time / total time | Per Seiler — minimize; target <5% of weekly volume |
| **Quality Intensity %** | Z4+ time / total time | The work that drives adaptation |
| **TID 7d vs 28d** | Seiler classification comparison | Consistent = stable, shifting = classification changed, acute_depolarization = PI dropped |
| **Durability** | Aggregate decoupling from steady-state sessions | VI ≤ 1.05, ≥ 90min, power data. Trend direction matters more than absolute values |
| **Efficiency Factor** | Aggregate EF from steady-state cycling | VI ≤ 1.05, ≥ 20min, power+HR. Rising EF = improving aerobic fitness. Compare like-for-like only |
| **HRRc** | Aggregate heart rate recovery from capability.hrrc | Largest 60s HR drop after threshold. Higher = better. Omit entire section if 28d < 3 qualifying sessions. Display only when `hrrc` is non-null per activity |
| **Power Curve Delta** | MMP comparison from capability.power_curve_delta | Rotation index + notable anchor shifts (≥2% change). Omit section if power_curve_delta.anchors is null. Sprint-biased (positive rotation) vs endurance-biased (negative) |
| **ACWR breakdown** | 7d acute / 28d chronic | Show components so athlete understands the ratio |
| **Wellness arrows** | Week-over-week comparison | ↑ improving, ↓ declining, → stable |
| **Avg Feel** | Activity-level average from `weekly_180d.avg_feel` | 1=Strong to 5=Weak. Count = sessions with feel populated. Omit line if 0 sessions. Lower is better |
| **Avg RPE** | Activity-level average from `weekly_180d.avg_rpe` | 1–10 Borg scale. Count = sessions with RPE populated. Omit line if 0 sessions |
| **Section 11 Flags** | Protocol flag triggers | Surface mid-week flags here, don't wait for block report |
| **Ramp rate** | CTL change per week | >1.5 = aggressive, monitor closely |

## Assessment Labels

| Metric | Good | Watch | Flag |
|--------|------|-------|------|
| ACWR | 0.80–1.30 (optimal) | 1.30–1.50 (elevated) | >1.50 (high risk) |
| Ramp rate | <1.0 (conservative) | 1.0–1.5 (moderate) | >1.5 (aggressive) |
| Grey Zone % | <5% (good) | 5–10% (watch) | >10% (too much Z3) |
| Decoupling (per-session) | <5% (good) | 5–10% (elevated) | >10% (flag) |
| Durability (7d mean) | <3% (good) | 3–5% (moderate) | >5% (declining) |
| Durability trend | improving/stable | declining | declining >2% vs 28d |
| EF trend | improving/stable | declining | declining >0.05 vs 28d |
| HRRc trend | improving (7d >10% above 28d) | stable (within 10%) | declining (7d >10% below 28d) |
| TID drift | consistent | shifting | acute_depolarization |
| HRV trend | ↑ or → (stable) | ↓ <5% (minor) | ↓ >10% (flag) |

## Notes

- **Session Breakdown** starts on Monday (or user's configured week start)
- **Phase narrative** is constructed from `phase_detection` fields: `phase_detection.phase` + `phase_detection.phase_duration_weeks` + `phase_detection.confidence`. If `phase_detection.previous_phase` differs from current phase, add transition note. Optionally surface 1-2 key `reason_codes` in plain English (e.g., `BUILD_HISTORY_REDUCED_LOAD_REBOUND_CONFIRMED` → "load resumed after deload")
- **Quality Session Detail** only includes hard/intensity sessions — omit recovery/endurance rides unless metrics were notable. Cap at 2–3 key sessions per week; if 4+ hard days occurred, prioritize sessions with the most notable targets, flags, or breakthroughs
- **HRRc** — three display cases: (1) omit entirely if 28d < 3 qualifying sessions; (2) show full trend line if both 7d and 28d have data; (3) show `[XX] bpm 28d mean([X]) — 7d: no data` if 28d qualifies but 7d has no qualifying sessions. Per-session HRRc can still appear in Quality Session Detail when present. HRRc is context-dependent: varies with exercise intensity, type, and when recording stopped. Trend direction over multiple sessions matters; single-session values are noisy
- **Section 11 Flags** should surface immediately in weekly reports, not deferred to block reports
- **Wellness arrows** use simple thresholds: >5% change from previous week = ↑ or ↓, otherwise →
- Keep "Interpretation" concise — this is coaching interpretation, not data repetition

## Formatting Rule

- **Durations and sleep:** Always use `_formatted` fields from JSON (e.g., `sleep_formatted`, `duration_formatted`, `total_training_formatted`). Never convert decimal `_hours` fields to display format — the formatted values are pre-calculated from raw seconds and avoid rounding errors.
